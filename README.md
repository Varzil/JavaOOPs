# Java Object Oriented Programming 




## Roadmap

- Module 1 has some basic programs (conditional, loops etc.)

- Module 2 has questions based on inheritance, polymorphism

- Module 3 has questions based on file handling



## Lessons Learned

Some classes are made in Offline Class so not every program is a part of the assignment.
